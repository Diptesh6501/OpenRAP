1. Not to type password for git every time?

    A. Use ssh instead of https for bitbucket:
        git config --global url."git@bitbucket.org:".insteadOF "https://bitbucket.org/"
    
    B. Upload your .ssh/id_rsa.pub public key to your bitbucket account

2. Upload a binary file using curl
# upload the jar
curl --data-binary @/mounted/target/scala-2.11/simple-project_2.11-1.0.jar localhost:8090/jars/test
